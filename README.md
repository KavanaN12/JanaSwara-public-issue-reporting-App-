This is basically a Public Issue Repoting app named janaswara, Janaswara is more than just a platform for reporting public issuesâ€”it's a movement for change. In an age where technology has the <b> power to connect communities </b>and decision-makers instantly, Janaswara harnesses this power to help citizens voice their concerns and get them addressed. Whether it's a complaint about a pothole, an unclean street, a broken traffic signal, or any other civic problem, Janaswara acts as a bridge between citizens and those in authority who can resolve the issues.
It has two phases(login Interfaces), namely publiclogin and authoritylogin.
Public can raise a complaint,check status of all their complaints, view all active complaints of other people,edit their profile.
While authority has an additional feature of updating status as inactive(resolved) once the complaint is resolved. 
Many additional features can be implimented so that it becomes user friendly, but in a given constraint this is the first commit. 
All suggesion accepted and are encouraged to add additional features to the web page.
